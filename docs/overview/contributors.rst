Contributing To This Codebase
=============================

General
-------
Thanks for looking into contributing to this codebase. As many open source projects are handled differently, it is best
to state some of my thinking in regards to contributions. Firstly, *all contributions are welcome* in this codebase.
If you only feel comfortable making a small change, whether to improve some text or fix a variable name, please do.

Pull Requests
-------------
To minimize the pain of pull requests, my current plan is as follows on the second and last weekend of the month
(US Mountain Time), I will actively look to merge any code that I can. One of my personal pet peeves is submitting
a pull request and not getting any feedback. As such I will try my best to reply to pull requests in a timely fashion.

Found a Bug
-----------
Open up a ticket, and Ill discuss whatever you found. The more detailed you are in what you think the issue is and
exact steps for someone to recreate will greatly aid in the debugging process.
